  /*
  Toggling Likes - Notes: 

  ðŸ‘‰ Why use `findOne()` before creating a new like?
     - We need to check if the user has already liked the video.
     - Prevents duplicate likes, ensuring one user can only like a video once.

  ðŸ‘‰ Why use `findByIdAndDelete()` instead of `deleteOne()`?
     - `findByIdAndDelete()` directly removes a document by `_id` in one step.
     - `deleteOne({ ... })` works too, but we already have the exact `_id`, so it's faster.

Liked Videos Query - Notes:
  
  ðŸ‘‰ What does `likedBy: userId` do?
     - Filters the `Like` collection to only include likes made by this user.
     - Without this filter, we'd get all likes from all users (which we donâ€™t want).
  
  ðŸ‘‰ What is `video: { $exists: true }`?
     - Ensures that we only fetch likes that are related to videos.
     - Without this, we'd also fetch likes on comments and tweets, which is not the goal here.
  
  ðŸ‘‰ Why use `.populate()`?
     - The `Like` model only stores a reference id to the liked video.
     - Using `.populate("video", "_id title url")` replaces that ID with actual video data.
     - This means the response includes useful info like `title` and `url`, not just an ID.
