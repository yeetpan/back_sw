 Toggling Subscription - Notes: 

  ðŸ‘‰ What does `Subscription.findOne()` do?
     - Searches for an existing subscription in the database.
     - If found, we remove it (unsubscribe). Otherwise, we create a new one (subscribe).

  ðŸ‘‰ Why use `findByIdAndDelete()` instead of `deleteOne()`?
     - `findByIdAndDelete()` finds a document by its `_id` and removes it in one step.
     - `deleteOne({ ... })` works too, but we already have the exact `_id`, so it's faster.

  ðŸ‘‰ Why use `.toString()` when comparing ObjectIds?
     - MongoDB IDs are objects, so `===` wonâ€™t work directly.
     - `.toString()` ensures they can be compared properly.

 Fetching Channel Subscribers - Notes:

ðŸ‘‰ Why do we use `req.user._id` instead of `req.params.channelId`?
   - The authenticated user (the one making the request) is the owner of the channel.
   - This ensures that users can only fetch their own subscribers, preventing unauthorized access.

ðŸ‘‰ What does `.populate("subscriber", "_id name email")` do?
   - By default, the `Subscription` collection stores only the `subscriber` ID.
   - `.populate("subscriber", "_id name email")` replaces the ID with actual subscriber details (name, email, etc.).
   - This reduces the need for multiple database queries and makes the response more useful.

ðŸ‘‰ Alternative ways to fetch subscribers?
   - `Subscription.find({ channel: channelId }).lean()`: Returns a plain JavaScript object instead of a Mongoose document.
